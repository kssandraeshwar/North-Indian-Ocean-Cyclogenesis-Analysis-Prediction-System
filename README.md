# 🌪️ North Indian Ocean Cyclogenesis Analysis & Prediction System

A data science and machine learning project designed to analyze and predict cyclonic activity in the North Indian Ocean (NIO) using historical meteorological data.

## 📌 Project Overview

Cyclogenesis—the formation of cyclones—is a significant climate event, especially in regions like the Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea. This project aims to:

- Analyze historical cyclone data for trends and patterns
- Build a machine learning model to predict cyclonic events
- Provide data-driven insights that could support early warning systems
